    Move Reminder Free allows you to use your phone as a pedometer and receive reminder notifications if you've been idle for
    too long. 

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    This app behaves similarly to the stand reminder found in Apple's smartwatches and works as follows:
    <ul>
        <li> You have a target goal of 12 movement hours each day. </li>
        <li> Each hour, the app will check your step count and if you have not moved for the hour, you will receive a reminder
            notification ten minutes before the end of the hour. </li>
        <li> The checks begin after your first active hour of the day and ends when you've reached your goal. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Do I need to keep the phone with me? </h3>
    Yes, you will need to keep your phone with you to detect step count.

    <h3>Does this app need to stay to open?</h3>
    No, your steps will still be counted and you will receive reminders even when the app is closed.

    <h3>Will this app work if my device does not have a step count sensor?</h3>
    It will vary by device. Try checking the step count after using the app for a few hours and decide if the accuracy is good
    enough for your use.
