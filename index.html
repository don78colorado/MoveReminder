    Move Reminder promotes a healthy lifestyle by utilizing your phone's built-in sensors to
    detect when you've been inactive for too long and reminds you to move.
    It's customizable and can also be used as a simple pedometer.
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    This app behaves similarly to the stand reminder found in Apple's smartwatches and works as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>You set the number of steps you want to move each hour</li>
        <li>You have a target goal of 12 active hours each day.</li>
        <li>Each hour, the app will check your step count and if you have not reached your goal that hour, you will
            receive a reminder
            notification ten minutes before the end of the hour.</li>
    </ul>
    <!--
         <li> The checks begin after your first active hour of the day and ends when you've reached your goal.</li>
    -->
    <h3>Does this app need to stay open to work?</h3>
    No, your steps will still be counted and you will receive reminders even when the app is closed.
    <h3>Do I need to keep the phone with me?</h3>
    Yes, you will need to keep your phone with you to detect step count.
    <h3>Will this app work if my device does not have a step count sensor?</h3>
    It will vary by device. Try checking the step count after using the app for a few hours and decide if the accuracy
    is good
    enough for your use.
    <h3>What is 'Smart mode'?</h3>
    Smart mode allows notification reminders to be delivered only after an active hour exists for the day.  This
    prevents you from being disturbed by reminders while you are sleeping since your first notification will only occur
    after you have moved for the day.  If you turn this feature off, you are eligible for reminders starting the hour
    specified by the 'Daily starting hour' setting.
    <h3>Why am I not receiving reminders when I should be?</h3>
    Some devices have settings/features that may interfere with the operation of the app. Specific settings and
    features will vary from phone to phone, but here are some things you could try:
    <ul>
        <li>If there are different battery optimization settings, try a less aggressive one.</li>
        <li>If there is a protected apps setting on your phone, add the app to the list.</li>
        <li>Don't swipe away to close the app. Let the app run in the background. In other words, you may press home to
            navigate to other apps but don't close <em>Move Reminder</em>. On some devices, closing the app completely
            will
            remove the hourly checking functionality of the app.</li>
    </ul>
