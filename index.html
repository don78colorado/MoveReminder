    Move Reminder Free allows you to use your phone as a pedometer and receive reminder notifications if you've been idle for
    too long.

    <h1> Do I need to keep the phone with me? </h1>
    Yes, you will need to keep your phone with you to detect step count.

    <h1>Does this app need to stay to open?</h1>
    No, your steps will still be counted and you will receive reminders even when the app is closed.

    <h1>Will this app work if my device does not have a step count sensor?</h1>
    It will vary by device. Try checking the step count after using the app for a few hours and decide if the accuracy is good
    enough for your use.
